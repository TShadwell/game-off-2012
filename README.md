Split!
=

A game for the [Github game off](https://github.com/github/game-off-2012)!

In split! you control a single guided missile, which, is inexplicably able to split itself at your perogative.Your goal is to survive as long as possible, destorying as many targets as possible, whilst not allowing all of your branches to be destroyed. At that point, it is game over.

Controls:

[space] split into two branches

[up/down] shift between the two 'main' branches

[left/right] speed up/slow down?
